Interest Rate Prediction with Deep Learning
===================
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to forecast the Federal Funds Effective Rate (interest rates) for the beginning months of 2025, as part of a deep learning course at Stevens Institute of Technology. The emphasis lies on the reasoning behind model design and interpretability rather than pure accuracy. Deliverables include Python code, a comprehensive model report explaining problem assumptions, model architecture, evaluation metrics, and results, along with a presentation summarizing findings. The project integrates interest rate data and optionally other publicly available data to explore relationships, with flexibility in the forecast duration (1 to 5 months). Clear documentation and presentation are key evaluation criteria.
